# Description
Maybe just copy the abstract?

# Tutorial
To run the experiments, execute the script ``experiment_real_world.py`` (or ``experiment_synthetic.py``) from the repository root. Note that running the experiments may take a long time. For shorter tests, it is advised to reduce the number of runs.

The data can be evaluated running the different scripts in the ``plot/`` directory.
